                <h2>Chapter 1: Introduction to Computers</h2>
                <p><strong>1. What is a computer and what does it do?</strong><br> A computer is an electronic device derived from the Latin word "computere," which means to calculate. It accepts raw facts and figures as input through input devices, processes this data according to user commands, stores it for future use, and produces meaningful information as output through output devices. The operation of a computer is based on the IPO (Input-Process-Output) cycle, where data is inputted, processed, and then outputted. The GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) principle emphasizes that the quality of output is directly related to the quality of input; if incorrect or poor-quality data is inputted, the output will also be flawed.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Describe the generations of computers.</strong><br> The evolution of computers is categorized into five generations, each marked by significant technological advancements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>First Generation (1946-1958):</strong> Utilized vacuum tubes for circuitry and magnetic drums for memory. These computers were large, consumed a lot of power, and generated significant heat, requiring air conditioning. They were primarily programmed using machine-level language and were not commercially viable due to their size and cost. Examples include ENIAC and UNIVAC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Second Generation (1959-1964):</strong> Introduced transistors, which replaced vacuum tubes, making computers smaller, faster, and more reliable. They consumed less power and generated less heat. Programming shifted to assembly language. However, they were still expensive and not widely used for commercial purposes. Examples include IBM 1401 and IBM 1620.</li>

                <h2>Chapter 2: Number System, Conversion and Boolean Logic</h2>
                <p><strong>1. What is 1's complement?</strong><br> 1's complement of a binary number is obtained by flipping all the bits, changing 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. For example, the 1's complement of (1011)₂ is (0100)₂.</p>
                <p><strong>2. What is 2's complement?</strong><br> 2's complement is found by adding 1 to the 1's complement of a binary number. For instance, if (1010)₂ is given, its 1's complement is (0101)₂, and adding 1 gives (0110)₂ as the 2's complement.</p>
                <p><strong>3. How do you perform subtraction using 1's complement?</strong><br> To subtract Y from X using 1's complement, first calculate the 1's complement of Y, then add it to X. If there is an extra bit, discard it and find the 1's complement of the result, adding a negative sign.</p>
                <p><strong>4. How do you perform subtraction using 2's complement?</strong><br> To subtract Y from X using 2's complement, calculate the 2's complement of Y and add it to X. If there is an extra bit, discard it. The result is the 2's complement of the sum, with a negative sign added.</p>
                <p><strong>5. What is Boolean Algebra?</strong><br> Boolean Algebra is a branch of algebra that deals with binary variables and logical operations. It uses binary values (0 and 1) to represent logical relationships and is fundamental in designing and analyzing digital circuits.</p>
                <p><strong>6. What are the basic Boolean operators?</strong><br> The three basic Boolean operators are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AND:</strong> Represented by “.” or “∧”, it outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>OR:</strong> Represented by “+” or “∨”, it outputs 1 if at least one input is 1.</li>
                        <li><strong>NOT:</strong> Represented by “-” or “’”, it inverts the input value (0 becomes 1 and vice versa).</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>7. What is a truth table?</strong><br> A truth table is a tabular representation that shows all possible input combinations and their corresponding output for a logical operation or circuit. It helps in understanding the behavior of logical gates.</p>
                <p><strong>8. What is an AND gate?</strong><br> An AND gate is a basic logic gate that outputs 1 only when both of its inputs are 1. Its truth table shows that the output is 0 for all other combinations of inputs.</p>
                <p><strong>9. What is a NAND gate?</strong><br> A NAND gate is the inverse of an AND gate. It outputs 0 only when both inputs are 1; otherwise, it outputs 1. It is represented as Y = (A.B)′.</p>
                <p><strong>10. What is De Morgan's Theorem?</strong><br> De Morgan's Theorem consists of two rules that relate the complement of a sum and the complement of a product:
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Theorem: (A + B)' = A' . B'</li>
                        <li>Second Theorem: (A . B)' = A' + B'</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>11. Convert the following numbers:</strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>a. Decimal to Binary:</strong><br>
    To convert a decimal number to binary, repeatedly divide the number by 2 and record the remainder. For example, to convert 13 to binary:
    <ul>
        <li>13 ÷ 2 = 6 remainder 1</li>
        <li>6 ÷ 2 = 3 remainder 0</li>
        <li>3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder 1</li>
        <li>1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder 1</li>
    </ul>
    Reading the remainders from bottom to top, 13 in decimal is (1101)₂.</p>

    <p><strong>b. Binary to Decimal:</strong><br>
    To convert a binary number to decimal, multiply each bit by 2 raised to the power of its position (starting from 0 on the right). For example, to convert (1101)₂ to decimal:
    <ul>
        <li>(1 × 2³) + (1 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰) = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, (1101)₂ is 13 in decimal.</p>

    <p><strong>c. Decimal to Octal:</strong><br>
    To convert a decimal number to octal, repeatedly divide the number by 8 and record the remainder. For example, to convert 65 to octal:
    <ul>
        <li>65 ÷ 8 = 8 remainder 1</li>
        <li>8 ÷ 8 = 1 remainder 0</li>
        <li>1 ÷ 8 = 0 remainder 1</li>
    </ul>
    Reading the remainders from bottom to top, 65 in decimal is (101)₈.</p>

    <p><strong>d. Octal to Decimal:</strong><br>
    To convert an octal number to decimal, multiply each digit by 8 raised to the power of its position. For example, to convert (101)₈ to decimal:
    <ul>
        <li>(1 × 8²) + (0 × 8¹) + (1 × 8⁰) = 64 + 0 + 1 = 65</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, (101)₈ is 65 in decimal.</p>

    <p><strong>e. Decimal to Hexadecimal:</strong><br>
    To convert a decimal number to hexadecimal, repeatedly divide the number by 16 and record the remainder. For example, to convert 255 to hexadecimal:
    <ul>
        <li>255 ÷ 16 = 15 remainder 15 (F)</li>
        <li>15 ÷ 16 = 0 remainder 15 (F)</li>
    </ul>
    Reading the remainders from bottom to top, 255 in decimal is (FF)₁₆.</p>

    <p><strong>f. Hexadecimal to Decimal:</strong><br>
    To convert a hexadecimal number to decimal, multiply each digit by 16 raised to the power of its position. For example, to convert (FF)₁₆ to decimal:
    <ul>
        <li>(15 × 16¹) + (15 × 16⁰) = 240 + 15 = 255</li>
    </ul>
    Thus, (FF)₁₆ is 255 in decimal.</p>

                <p><strong>3. What is a cell reference in Excel?</strong><br>
                    A cell reference in Excel indicates the location of a cell within a spreadsheet. It is determined by the combination of the column letter and the row number. For example, the cell reference "A1" refers to the cell located in column A and row 1. Cell references are crucial when writing formulas, as they allow users to perform calculations based on the values contained in other cells. For instance, to add the values in cells A1 and A2, you would write the formula in A3 as <code>A3=A1+A2</code> instead of hardcoding the values.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. What are the two types of cell references in Excel?</strong><br>
                    There are two main types of cell references in Excel:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Relative Cell Reference:</strong> This type of reference adjusts automatically when the formula is copied to another cell. For example, if you have a formula in cell B1 that references A1, and you copy it to B2, the reference will change to A2. Relative references are the default in Excel and are written simply as <code>A1</code>, <code>B4</code>, etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Absolute Cell Reference:</strong> This type of reference remains fixed on a specific cell, regardless of where the formula is copied. Absolute references are denoted by dollar signs before the column letter and row number, such as <code>$A$2</code> or <code>$G$9</code>. You can easily create an absolute reference by selecting the cell reference and pressing the <code>F4</code> key.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p><strong>5. What is MS-PowerPoint and what are its key features?</strong><br>
                    MS-PowerPoint is a presentation software that is part of the Microsoft Office suite. It allows users to create dynamic and professional presentations using pre-defined layouts, themes, and templates. Key features of MS-PowerPoint include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Formatting Tools:</strong> Users can enhance the appearance of their presentations using various formatting options such as font styles, colors, and hyperlinks.</li>

                <h2>Chapter 5: Programming Concepts</h2>
                <p><strong>1. What are the different types of language translators and their functions?</strong><br>
                    Language translators are system development software that convert programs written in high-level or assembly language into machine-level language. The main types of language translators include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Assembler:</strong> Converts programs written in assembly language into machine code. Since assembly language is close to machine language, the conversion is relatively straightforward and done at once.</li>
                        <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> Translates entire programs written in high-level languages (like C, C++, and Java) into machine code at once. This method is efficient but can be complex for debugging.</li>
                        <li><strong>Interpreter:</strong> Converts high-level language programs into machine code one line at a time. This makes debugging easier, but execution is slower compared to compiled programs. Languages like BASIC, C#, and PHP typically use interpreters.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            
                <p><strong>2. What are the types of errors in programming, and how are they classified?</strong><br>
                    Errors in programming, commonly referred to as "bugs," can prevent a program from executing correctly. They are classified into three main types:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Syntax Error:</strong> Occurs when the rules of the programming language are not followed. These errors can be detected by compilers and interpreters. For example, forgetting to end a statement with a semicolon in C.</li>
                        <li><strong>Logical Error:</strong> Arises from incorrect logic or misunderstanding of the problem, leading to incorrect results. These errors are not detected by language processors. For example, using the wrong formula for calculating simple interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>Runtime Error:</strong> Occurs while the program is executing, often due to insufficient resources or hardware issues. These errors are also not detected by language translators. For example, trying to access a file that does not exist.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><strong>3. What are C Tokens?</strong><br>
                    C Tokens are the basic building blocks of a C program. They are the smallest individual units in a program that the compiler recognizes. The set of identifiers, keywords, constants, variables, and operators is known as C Tokens. During compilation, the compiler treats these tokens as single units and does not break them down further.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Define the following terms:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identifiers:</strong> Names used to identify entities in a C program, such as variables, arrays, functions, structures, unions, and labels.</li>
                    <li><strong>Keyword:</strong> A reserved word in C that has a predefined meaning and cannot be used as an identifier. Examples include <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>int</code>, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> Define the type of data a variable can store. Common data types in C include:
                        <ul>
                            <li><code>int:</code> Represents integer values (2 bytes).</li>
                            <li><code>float:</code> Represents floating-point numbers (4 bytes).</li>
                            <li><code>char:</code> Represents a single character (1 byte).</li>
                            <li><code>void:</code> Represents no value or null.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Constants:</strong> Fixed values that do not change during program execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Named storage locations in memory that can hold data and whose values can change during program execution.</li>
                    <li><strong>Statements:</strong> Combinations of keywords, identifiers, operators, variables, and constants that perform actions. They can be simple (single line) or compound (multiple lines enclosed in curly brackets).</li>
                    <li><strong>Escape Sequences:</strong> Special character combinations that represent certain formatting in strings, such as <code>\n</code> for new line and <code>\t</code> for horizontal tab.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Types include arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, and more.</li>
                    <li><strong>Library Functions:</strong> Predefined functions in C that perform specific tasks, such as <code>printf()</code> for output and <code>scanf()</code> for input.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>5. What are the differences between library functions and user-defined functions?</strong><br>
                Library functions are predefined functions provided by the C standard library that can be used in any program, such as <code>printf()</code> and <code>scanf()</code>. User-defined functions, on the other hand, are functions created by the programmer to perform specific tasks within their program. They allow for code reusability and better organization of code.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Define Decision Making Statements.</strong><br>
                    Decision making statements in C are used to execute different actions based on certain conditions. These statements allow the program to make choices and control the flow of execution. The most common decision making statements are <code>if</code>, <code>if...else</code>, and <code>switch</code>.</p>
                
                <p><strong>1. <code>if</code> Statement:</strong><br>
                The <code>if</code> statement is used to test a condition. If the condition evaluates to true, the block of code inside the <code>if</code> statement is executed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
                <pre>
if (condition) {
    // Block of statements to be executed if condition is true
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Check if a number is positive.</p>
                <pre>
#include <stdio.h>
void main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    if (num > 0) {
        printf("The number is positive.");
    }
    getch();
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>2. <code>if...else</code> Statement:</strong><br>
                The <code>if...else</code> statement allows for two possible paths of execution based on a condition. If the condition is true, the first block of statements is executed; if false, the second block is executed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
                <pre>
if (condition) {
    // Block of statements if condition is true
} else {
    // Block of statements if condition is false
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Check if a number is even or odd.</p>
                <pre>
#include <stdio.h>
void main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    if (num % 2 == 0) {
        printf("The number is even.");
    } else {
        printf("The number is odd.");
    }
    getch();
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>3. <code>switch</code> Statement:</strong><br>
                The <code>switch</code> statement is used to execute one block of code among many based on the value of a variable or expression.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Syntax:</strong></p>
                <pre>
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // Block of statements for value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // Block of statements for value2
        break;
    default:
        // Block of statements if no case matches
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> Determine the day of the week based on a number.</p>
                <pre>
#include <stdio.h>
void main() {
    int day;
    printf("Enter a number (1-7): ");
    scanf("%d", &day);
    switch (day) {
        case 1:
            printf("Monday");
            break;
        case 2:
            printf("Tuesday");
            break;
        case 3:
            printf("Wednesday");
            break;
        case 4:
            printf("Thursday");
            break;
        case 5:
            printf("Friday");
            break;
        case 6:
            printf("Saturday");
            break;
        case 7:
            printf("Sunday");
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid input");
    }
    getch();
}
                </pre>
                
                <p><strong>7. What are the advantages of Using Arrays?</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Organized Data Storage:</strong> Arrays allow you to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable, making it easier to manage related data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Efficient Memory Usage:</strong> Arrays use contiguous memory locations, which can lead to better performance and efficient memory usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Random Access:</strong> You can access any element in an array directly using its index, allowing for quick retrieval and modification of data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy Iteration:</strong> Arrays can be easily traversed using loops, making it simple to perform operations on each element.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Code Clarity:</strong> Using arrays can make your code cleaner and more readable, especially when dealing with large datasets.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Simple Example Program: Using Arrays</strong></p>
                <p>This program demonstrates how to declare an array, initialize it, and print its elements.</p>
                <pre>
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int numbers[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};  // Declaration and initialization of an array
    int i;

    printf("Elements of the array are:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {  // Loop to access and print each element
        printf("%d\n", numbers[i]);
    }
    getch();
}
                </pre>

                <p><strong>Write a C program code to display this pattern.</strong></p>
                <p>This program demonstrates how to use nested for loops to display a pattern of stars.</p>
                <pre>
#include <stdio.h>

void main() {
    int i, j, rows;

    // Number of rows for the star pattern
    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    // Outer loop for each row
    for (i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        // Inner loop for printing stars
        for (j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");  // Print star followed by a space
        }
        printf("\n");  // Move to the next line after each row
    }

    getch();
}
                </pre>

                <p><strong>Sample Output:</strong></p>
                <p>If the user inputs 5, the output will be:</p>
                <pre>
*

* * * * * 
                </pre>

                <p><strong>9. Write down String Functions used in C along with their syntax.</strong><br> 
                C provides a variety of built-in functions for manipulating strings.<br> 

                <ul>
                    <li><strong><code>strlen()</code></strong>: 
                        <p>Purpose: Returns the length of a string (excluding the null terminator).</p>
                        <p>Syntax: <code>size_t strlen(const char *str);</code></p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong><code>strcpy()</code></strong>: 
                        <p>Purpose: Copies one string to another.</p>
                        <p>Syntax: <code>char *strcpy(char *dest, const char *src);</code></p>
                    </li>

                    <li><strong><code>strcat()</code></strong>: 
                        <p>Purpose: Concatenates (appends) one string to the end of another.</p>
                        <p>Syntax: <code>char *strcat(char *dest, const char *src);</code></p>

                    <br>Legal Provisions in Nepal to Preserve Intellectual Property Rights:
                    Nepal has established several legal provisions to protect and preserve intellectual property rights. The key legal instruments are:
                    
                    <br>Copyright Act, 2059 (2002): This law governs the protection of literary, artistic, and scientific works in Nepal. It ensures that authors and creators have exclusive rights over their works, and it also addresses issues related to unauthorized copying, distribution, and performance.
                    
                    <br>Patent, Design, and Trademark Act, 1965: This Act regulates the protection of patents, industrial designs, and trademarks in Nepal. It ensures that inventors, designers, and brand owners can register their intellectual properties and prevent unauthorized use. The Act also lays out the process for patenting new inventions and registering trademarks and designs.
                    
                    <br>Industrial Property Act, 1997: This Act focuses on patents, trademarks, industrial designs, and geographical indications. It provides the legal framework for registering patents and trademarks, and enforcing rights over them.
                    
                    <br>Trade Secret Protection: Although Nepal does not have a specific law solely dedicated to trade secrets, trade secret protection is provided under general contractual agreements and the principles of unfair competition, ensuring that confidential business information remains protected from unauthorized use.
                    
                    <br>Nepal’s Membership in International Conventions: Nepal is a member of several international treaties and agreements to ensure global protection of intellectual property, such as:
                    
                    <br>World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO): Nepal is a member of WIPO, which helps create international agreements for IP protection.
                    Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property: This convention provides international protection for patents, trademarks, and industrial designs.<br>
                    Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works: This convention ensures international protection for copyrights across member countries.<br>
                    TRIPS Agreement (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights): This agreement, under the World Trade Organization (WTO), requires member countries, including Nepal, to adhere to minimum standards for IP protection.<br>
                    Nepal Rastra Bank's Role in Protecting IP: The central bank and other regulatory bodies work to protect IP in Nepal, particularly in the area of e-commerce, online business, and digital transactions, helping safeguard digital IP rights.</p>
                    
                <p><strong>4. Explain digital signature along with its working mechanism.</strong><br> A digital signature is a cryptographic method used to validate the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents. It works similarly to a handwritten signature but offers higher security by ensuring the identity of the signer and guaranteeing that the content has not been altered. Digital signatures are based on asymmetric cryptography, involving a pair of keys: a private key (kept secret by the signer) and a public key (shared for verification). When a document is signed, a unique hash (a fixed-size representation) of the content is generated using a hashing algorithm. The signer then encrypts this hash with their private key, creating the digital signature, which is appended to the document.<br>

                    To verify a digital signature, the recipient uses the public key of the signer to decrypt the signature, obtaining the original hash. The recipient then generates their own hash of the received document. If the decrypted hash matches the one calculated by the recipient, it confirms the signature's authenticity and assures that the document has not been tampered with. This process ensures authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation, as it proves that the message or document truly came from the signer and has not been modified. Digital signatures are essential in fields like e-commerce, digital contracts, and secure communication, providing a trustworthy method for electronic transactions and agreements.</p>
